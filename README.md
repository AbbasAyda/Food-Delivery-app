# Food delivery app using Node-express-passport-mongodb

![Food delivery app](https://github.com/Avijeetas/Food-Delivery-app/blob/master/food.png?raw=true)


In this project, 
I have used 
  - Nodejs for backend 
  - Express to structure a web application to handle multiple different http requests at a specific url.
  - passport for register and login route, to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as strategies.
  - Axios to send asynchronous HTTP requests to REST endpoints and perform CRUD operations.
  - Mongodb as a database, used for storing sessions, menu, and user 
  - [ ] the project is not completed

After download or clone run `npm install` OR `yarn install` to install all the dependancies.
